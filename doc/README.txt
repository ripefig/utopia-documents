Utopia Documents is PDF reader that displays interactive annotations
on scientific articles.  By connecting the static content of
scientific articles to the dynamic world of online content it makes it
easy to explore an article's content and claims, and investigate other
recent articles that discuss the same or similar topics.

Explore the sidebar to get immediate access to an article's metadata
and browse the relationship it has with the world at large. Generate a
formatted citation for use in your own work, follow bibliographic
links to cited articles, or get a document's related data at the click
of a button.

Various extensions provide links to blogs, online data sources and
to social media sites so you can see what other researchers have been
saying about not only the article you're reading but its subject
matter too.
