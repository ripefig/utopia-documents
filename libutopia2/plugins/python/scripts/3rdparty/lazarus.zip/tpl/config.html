  Lazarus uncovers inter-connections buried in scientific literature by reading articles alongside you and identifying the most important concepts in the research presented.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="http://utopiadocs.com/lazarus">Learn more about Lazarus...</a>
</p>
<p>
  To help Lazarus achieve this goal, it needs permission from you to allow it to access the articles you read and learn what is important. All data collected is entirely anonymous.
